# Calculating probability

If a process is repeated in identical fashion a very large number of times, the probability of a given outcome is defined as the fraction of the results corresponding to that particular outcome.

$$
\textrm{probability of given outcome} = \frac{\textrm{number of times that outcome occurs}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes}}
$$

The nature of the fraction above shows that the probability of any given outcome cannot be smaller than 0 or larger than 1. A probability of 0 represents impossibility, while a probability of 1 represents inevitability. The close the probability of a given outcome is to 1, the more likely that outcome is to occur. 

When a coin is tossed fairly, the likelihood of it landing on heads is equal to the likelihood of it landing on tails. If it is tossed repeatedly a great many times, it will in theory come up heads half the time: the probability of tossing heads is $\frac{1}{2}$. The theroetical probability of tossing tails is, of course, also $\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of these two probabilities $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$; i.e. it is certain that when the coin is tossed it will land either on heads or tails. This is an example of a general rule:

**The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is equal to 1.**

Dice games involve rolling six-sided dice (singluar "die"). If the die is not loaded and the roling is done farily, then all outcomes are equally likely ($\frac{1}{6}$). Again, the sum of the probabilities of all the possible outcomes is $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1$.

So on one roll of the die the probability of scoring a three is $\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability of _not_ scoring a three is $1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$. Another way of saying this is that while there is 1 way of rolling a 3, there are 5 ways of _not_ rolling a 3. Clearly it is more likely than not that a number other than three will be rolled. This is just one illustration of another general rule:

**The most likely outcome is the one that can occur in the greatest number of ways.**

Provided nothing biases the result to make one outcome inherently more likely than others, the definition for probability given above can be rewritten to encompass the number of ways in which a particular outcome may come about:

$$
\textrm{probability of given outcome} = \frac{\textrm{number of ways to get that particular outcome}}{\textrm{total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

According to the equation above, probability is defined as a fraction. However a fraction may also be expressed as a decimal number or as a percentage.

$$
\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%
$$

The statements:

- the probability of event A is $\frac{1}{4}$
- the probability of A occuring is 0.25
- there is a 25% probability of the outcome being A

are therefore all equivalent.

In addition, particularly in spoken language, it is common to say "there is a 1 in 4 probability of the outcome being A."
