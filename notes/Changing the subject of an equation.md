# Changing the subject of an equation

We may wish to rearrange an equation, to change its subject, as some equations have more than one algebraic symbol that is unknown. The equation may be expressed in terms of $x$: $x = y + 4$. You may wish to know what the equation would look like if it were expressed in terms of %y%.

The critical thing with any equation is that you must always carry out the same operations on each side of the equals sign. If, for example, you subtract $x$ from one side but not the other, it changes the equation completely. Since the quantites on each side of an equation are the same, anything done to one side must be done to the other to maintain the equality.

Say you wish to rearrange $x = y + 3$ so that $y$ becomes the subject of the equation. You can subtract 3 from both sides of the equals sign and simplify:

$$ 
x = y + 3 \\ \ \\
x - 3 = y + 3 - 3 \\ \ \\
x - 3 = y
$$

which would be written as:

$$y = x - 3$$

to follow the convention that the subject is on the left of the equals sign.

As another example, say you wish to rearrange $x = \frac{y}{5} - 2$ so thar $y$ becomes the subject of the equation.

First, multiply both sides by 5: $5x = y - 10$

> Note that every term on the right has been multiplied by 5

Then add 10 to each side: $5x + 10 = y$ and place the subject on the left: $y = 5x + 10$.

## Exercises
Rearrange the equations to make x the subject of the equation:

1) $x - 5 = y$
> $x = y + 5$

2) $3x - 3 = y$
> $x = \frac{y}{3} - 1$

3) $\frac{x}{2} = 3y$
> $x = 6y$

4) $\frac{x}{7} - 4 = 2y$
> $x = 14y + 28$

5) $\frac{x}{2.5} = 10y$
> $x = 25y$

6) $2x - 12 = 2y$
> $x = y + 6$
