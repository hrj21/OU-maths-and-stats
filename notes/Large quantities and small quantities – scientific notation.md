# Large quantities and small quantities – scientific notation

Scientists frequently work with enormous or tiny quantities. Powers of ten provide a convenient way of writing down very large or very small numbers. For example:

$10^6 = 1,000,000$ and $10^{-3} = 1/1000 = 0.001$

This shorthand can be extended to any quantity simply by multilying the power of 10 by a small number, for instance:

$2 \times 10^6 = 2 \times 1,000,000 = 2,000,000$
$3.5 \times 10^6 = 3,500,00$
$7 \times 10^{-3} = 0.007$

This is known as **scientific notation** (or standard form).

A quantity is said to be expressed in scientific notation if its value is written as a number multiplied by a power of 10. 

The number can be an integer or a decimal number, but it must be $\ge$ 1 and $<$ 10. So neither $75 \times 10^2$ nor $0.75 \times 10^4$ are in scientific notation (both are equivalent to $7.5 \times 10^3$, which *is* in scientific notation).

Therefore scientific notation may be defines as a notation in which the value of a quantity is written in the form $a \times 10^n$, where $n$ is an integer and $1 \leq a < 10$.

To move from scientific notation to integers or to deciml notation, first deal with the power of ten, then carry out the multiplication or division.

## Exercises 1
Express the following numbers as integers or decimal notation
a) $4.53 \times 10^3 = 4.53 \times 1000 = 4530$
b) $8.371 \times 10^2 = 8.371 \times 100 = 837.1$
c) $6.4 \times 10^{-3} = 6.4 \times 0.01 = 0.0064$

## Exercises 2
Express the following numbers as integers or in decimal notation
a) $5.4 \times 10^4 = 54,000$
b) $2.1 \times 10^{-2} = 0.021$
c) $0.6 \times 10^{-1} = 0.06$

Moving from an integer or decimal notation to scientific notation is equivalent to deciding what power of ten you need to multiply or divide by in order to convert the number you start with into a number that lies between 1 and 10.

## Exercises 3
Express the following numbers in scientific notation
a) $356,000 = 3.56 \times 10^5$
b) $49.7 \times 10^4 = 4.97 \times 10^5$
c) $0.831 = 8.31 \times 10^{-1}$

## Exercises 4
Express the following numbers in scientific notation
a) $215 = 2.15 \times 10^2$
b) $46.7 = 4.67 \times 10$
c) $152 \times 10^3 = 1.52 \times 10^5$
d) $0.0000876 = 8.76 \times 10^5$

Another way to work out the scientific notation is to count how many positions you move the decimal point to help find the power of ten. Moving it to the left increases the power of 10 by 1 for each position moved. Moving it to the right decreases the power of 10 by 1.
