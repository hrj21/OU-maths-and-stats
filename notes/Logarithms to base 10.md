# Logarithms to base 10

In week 1 you learned about the rules for indices and in week 2 you were introduced to logarithmic scales. This week uses ideas from both of these weeks, as you turn your attention to logarithms. These were invented in the seventeenth century by John Napier as a way to make calculations involving multiplication and division easier. Before electronic tools were cheaply and commonly available these were an invaluable aid, and this is still the case today. 

Logarithms are very closely related to powers ad can have any base number. However, one of the most commonly used was the logarithm to base 10, also known as the common logarithm. The process of taking a log to base 10, is the inverse (opposite operation) of raising the base 10 to a power).

In the example $10^3 = 1000$, 3 is the index or the power to which the number 10 is raised.

When you take the logarithm to base 10, of 1000, the answer is 3. This is written as

$$
\textrm{Log}_{10}(1000) = 3
$$

Hence, the logarithm is the index to which the base was raised:

$$
\textrm{Log}_{10}10^n = n
$$

So $10^3 = 1000$ and $\textrm{log}_{10}(1000) = 3$ express the same fact but the latter is in the language of logarithms.

If a number can be written in the form $a^x$, then the index is called the logarithm of y to the base a.

- If $y = a^x$ then $\textrm{log}_a y = x$
- Since $2 = 2^1$, then $\textrm{log}_2(2) = 1$
- Similarly, $\textrm{log}_3 (3) = 1$ and $\textrm{log}_{10} (10) = 1$, and as $a = a^1$, then $\textrm{log}_a (a) = 1$

## Exercise
Without a calculator, work out the values of:

1) $\textrm{log}_{10}(10)$
> 1

2) $\textrm{log}_{10}(100)$
> 2

3) $\textrm{log}_{10}(0.01)$
> -2

4) $\textrm{log}_{10}(1 000 000)$
> 6
