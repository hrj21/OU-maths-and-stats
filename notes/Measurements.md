# Measurements

Different measurment systems are used for different things and in different countries. For example, some things are measured using the metric system (pints and miles), while the metric system has been adopted for others (litres and kilometers). In science, a universal SI (Système International d’Unités) is used.

By the end of this week you will have:

- gained an understanding of SI units and prefixes
- identified the order of magnitude of a value
- started to gain an understanding of logarithms
- considered the precision of measurements
- gained an understanding of rounding using significant figures

## Units of measurement

In the SI system, there are 7 *base units* (shown in the table below). Every other kind of measureable quantity can be made up from combinations of just these seven base units. For instance, speed is measured in meters per second.

| Physical quantity  | Name of unit | Symbol for unit |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| length             | meter        | m               |
| time               | second       | s               |
| mass               | kilogram     | kg              |
| temperature        | Kelvin       | K               |
| amount of substance| mole         | mol             |
| electric current   | ampere       | A               |
| luminous intensity | candela      | cd              |

Prefixes to these base units are used to conveniently scale them by orders of 1000.

| Prefix | Symbol | Multiplying factor                 |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| tera   | T      | $10^{12} = 1000,000,000,000$       |
| giga   | G      | $10^9 = 1000,000,000$              |
| mega   | M      | $10^6 = 1000,000$                  |
| kilo   | k      | $10^3 = 1000$                      |
| -      | -      | $10^0 = 1$                         |
| milli  | m      | $10^{-3} = 0.001$                  |
| micro  | μ      | $10^{-6} = 0.000,001$              |
| nano   | n      | $10^{-9} = 0.000,000,001$          |
| pico   | p      | $10^{-12} = 0.000,000,000,001$     |
| femto  | f      | $10^{-15} = 0.000,000,000,000,001$ |

There are also some prefixes in common use, which don’t appear in Box 2 because they don’t conform to the ‘multiples of 1000’ rule, but never the less produce convenient measures. One is centi (hundredth): rulers show centimetres (hundredths of a metre) as well as millimetres, and standard wine bottles are marked as holding 75 cl. One less commonly seen is deci (tenth), but that is routinely used by chemists in measuring concentrations of chemicals dissolved in water, or other solvents. Later this week you will also come across the decibel, which is used to measure the loudness of sounds.

## Exercise 1
Diamond is a crystalline form of carbon in which the distance between adjacent carbon atoms is 0.154 nm. What is this interatomic distance expressed in picometres?
> 154pm

## Exercise 2
Using scientific notation, express
a) 3476km (the diameter of the moon) in meters
> $3.476 \times 10^6$m

b) 8.0μm (the diameter of a capillary carrying blood in the body) in nm
> $8 \times 10^3$nm

c) 0.8s (a typical time between human heartbeats) in ms
> $8 \times 10^2$ms
