# Natural logarithms

The most frequently used bases for logarithms as 10 and the number $e$. Rather like $\pi$, the irrational number $e$ occurs frequently in many branches of mathematics and its applications to science and engineering. Logarithms to base 10 are known as common logarithms and those to base $e$ are called natural or Napierian logarithms, after the mathematician who discovered them.

Natural logarithms have the property

$$
\textrm{log}_e e^x = x
$$

Natural logarithms are used to solve equations that contain the exponential function $e^x$, where $e$ is the irrational number 2.718281828 (to 10 s.f.). A graph of this function is shown below.

An example of the exponential function in science is radioactive decay. The half-life of a radioactive element is a constant value. This means that no matter how long the decay process has been continuing for, it always takes the same time for the radioactivity to fall by half. If you compare the figure above to the figure below, you should be able to see they have similar shapes - although the one above shows growth while the one below shows decay.

When you work with logarithms to base 10 it is convenient to drop the subscript and just write $\textrm{log }x$. Natural logarithms are writtn as $\textrm{ln }x$. This means that the rules for logarithms can be written as follows for natural logarithms.

**Rule 1**
$$
\textrm{ln }xy = \textrm{ln }x + \textrm{ln }y
$$

**Rule 2**
$$
\textrm{ln }\frac{x}{y} = \textrm{ln }x - \textrm{ln }y
$$

**Rule 3**
$$
\textrm{ln }x^r = r \times \textrm{ln }x
$$

## Exercise
Solve the equations for $x$, showing your answers using natural logs. For example, $5 \times \textrm{ln }3$. Remember that $\textrm{ln }e^x = x$.

1) $15 = 3e^{2x}$
> $5 = e^{2x}$ (divide both sides by 3)
> $\textrm{ln }5 = 2x$ (as $\textrm{log}_a b = c$ where $a^c = b$)
> $x = \frac{\textrm{ln }5}{2}$ (solve for $x$)

2) $2e^{-x/10}+16 = 20$
> $e^{-x/10} = 10 - 8$ (divide both sides by 2 and subtract 8)
> $\frac{-x}{10} = \textrm{ln }2$ (take natural log of both sides)
> $x = -10 \times \textrm{ln }2$ (solve for $x$)
