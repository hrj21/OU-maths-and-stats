## Numbers - 8th September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/21J RR Session 1.pdf)

- Natural numbers ($\mathbb{N}$) are *whole* and *positive* e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 ... (counting numbers, not zero)

- Integers are ($\mathbb{Z}$) *whole* numbers and are the set that includes 0 e.g. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...

- Rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) can be written as fractions of two integers. When you convert a rational number to a decimal it will either terminate (e.g. 1/2 = 0.5), or recur (e.g. 1/3 = 0.333...)

- Irrational numbers can not be written as fractions of integers and fill in the space between the rationals. When you convert an irrational number to a decimal it will not terminate or recur

- Real numbers are the set of numbers that are not complex/imaginary and contain all the sets considered thus far

- Complex numbers ($\mathbb{C}$) contain real and imaginary parts (more in later units)

## Algebra - 10th September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/Session 2 Algebra 21J.pdf)

- A **variable** is a letter used to represent a number
- An **expression** is a collection of letters, numbers and/or maths symbols
- An **equation** is two expressions with an equals sign between them
- A **term** is an item that can be added or subtracted in an expression
- A **constant** is a number without a variable
- A **coefficient** is a number multiplied by a combination of letters

## Linear equations - 14th September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/Session+3+Linear+equations+21J.pptx)

- Linear equations are any equation that can be written in the form $y = mx + c$
- They do not contain powers, roots, or trig functions
- Simultaneous equations represent two linear equations that have a common solution where their graphs cross (if they cross)
- There are two methods for solving simultaneous equations:
  - The elimination method (subtract the equations to remove one variable)

$$
9x - 2y = 12 \\ 
5x - y = 14\\ \ \\

10x - 2y = 28 \\
9x - 2y = 12 \\ \ \\

x = 16 \\ \ \\

5(16) - y = 14 \\
80-y = 14 \\
y = 66
$$
  - The substitution method (make one variable the subject)

$$
9x - 2y = 12 \\
5x - y = 14 \\ \ \\

y = 5x - 14 \\ \ \\

9x - 2(5x-14) = 12 \\
9x - 10x + 28 = 12 \\
-x = -16 \\
x = 16 \\
\textrm{then substitute to find y as above}
$$

## Quadratics - 16th September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/Session 4 Quadratics 21J slides.pdf)

- Quadratic equations can be written in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$
- The graph of a quadratic forms a parabola
- The constant $c$ is where the parabola intersects the y axis
- The vertex is the coordinate of the "peak" of the parabola

![](@attachment/Quad graph 1.png)

- The axis of symmetry is the x value of the vertex of the graph
- Positive values of $a$ give a "u" shape, negative values of $a$ give an "n" shape
- Higher absolute values of $a$ give steeper curves

![](@attachment/Quad graph 2.png)

- There are three ways of writing quadratic expressions:
  - Common form: $ax^2 + bx + c$
  e.g. $x^2 + 5x + 2$
  - Factorised form: $a(x - r)(x + s)$
  e.g. $(x - 3)(x + 2)$
  - Completed square form: $a(x - h)^2 + k$
  e.g. $(x + 1)^2 - 3$

- Factorising
  - The reverse process of expanding backets
  - Take out the highest common factor and place outside the brackets, or write as a product of two sets of brackets
  - For expressions in the form $ax^2 + bx$:
  $6x^2 + 4x = 2x(3x + 2)$
  - For expressions in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$:
  $x^2 + 3x - 10 = (x - 2)(x + 5)$
  - Or find the difference of two squares: $x^2 - p^2 = (x - p)(x + p)$

- Completing the square 
  - Re-write in the form: $x^2 + 2px = (x + p)^2 - p^2$
  e.g. $x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 3^2 = (x + 3)^2 - 9$
  - Note that $p$ is always half the coefficient of $x$
  - $abs(p)$ is always subtracted from the brackets
  - When $a \neq 1$, factorise the expression first:
$$
2y^2 + 8y \\ 
2(y^2 - 4y) \\
2[(y - 2)^2 - 2^2] \\
2(y - 2)^2 - 8)
$$

  - The completed square form $a(x - h)^2 + k$ allows us to easily find the axis of symmetry and the vertex of the graph
  - As $(x - h)^2$ is positive or zero for all values of $x$ (smallest is zero), the vertex must be the coordinate where $x$ makes $(x - h)^2$ = 0, and $y = k$
  - So for the parabola $y = (x - 2)^2 - 4$, the vertex is (2,-4)

![](@attachment/Completed square graph.png)

- Solving quadratic equations where one side of the equation equals 0 represents finding where they cut the x axis
- Three methods:
  - Factorisation
  e.g.

  $$
  x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \\
  (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \\
  \therefore x - 2 = 0 \textrm{ and } x - 3 = 0 \\
  \therefore x = 2 \textrm{ or } x = 3
  $$

  - Completing the square
  e.g.

  $$
  x^2 + 6x - 7 = 0 \\
  (x + 3)^2 - 3^2 - 7 = 0 \\
  (x + 3)^2 - 16 = 0 \\
  (x + 3)^2 = 16 \\
  x + 3 = \pm4 \\
  \therefore x + 3 = 4 \textrm{ and } x + 3 = -4 \\
  \therefore x = 1 \textrm{ or } x = -7
  $$

  - Quadratic formula
    - For the general formula $ax^2 + bx^2 + c = 0$
    - $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
    - Derived by completing the square
    - e.g.

  $$
  x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 6}}{2 \times 1} \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \\ \ \\
  \therefore x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \textrm{ and } x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
  $$

    
  - Pros of quadratic formula:
    - Always works
    - The discriminant reveals additional information (the expression under the $\sqrt{}$)
  - Cons of quadratic formula:
    - Don't forget to compute both terms (positive and negative)
    - Magnet for algebraic errors
    - If answers turn out to be rational (no surds) then there was a simple factorisation that wasn't spotted

  - The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$ (not its root)
  - If the discriminant is positive, there are two solutions
  - If the iscriminant is negative, there are no solutions
  - If the discriminant is 0, there is a single solution

![](@attachment/Discriminant.png)

Note that the quadratic formula can be written as:

$$
x = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The $\frac{-b}{2a}$ expression represents the axis of symmetry, and the $\pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ represents the distance needed to travel either side of this axis so $x = 0$.

## Trigonometry - 22nd September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/Session+5+Trigonometry+-21J.pptx)

- Basic trigonometry is about the relationships between the lengths of the sides and angles in right-angled triangles
- In any triangle, the longest side is opposite the biggest angle and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle
- When all sides are scaled equally, the trig ratios remain the unchanged

![](@attachment/Triangle ratios.png)

- $x = \sin^{-1}(\sin{x})$
- sin = arcsin = asin (equivalent terminology)
- Do not confuse $\sin^{-1}x$ (inverse of $\sin x$) with $\sin(x)^{-1}$ (reciprocal of $\sin x$)
- 30, 60, 90 and 45, 45, 90 angle triangles are useful to remember
$$
\sin{30} = \frac{1}{2}; \quad \sin{60} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}; \quad \tan{45} = 1
$$

![](@attachment/Useful triangles.png)

- Relationship between sin and cosine

$$
\sin{x} = \cos{(90 - x)} \\
\cos{x} = \sin{(90 - x)}
$$

- Relationship between sin, cos, and tan of $x$

$$
\frac{\sin{x}}{\cos{x}} = \frac{\frac{O}{H}}{\frac{A}{H}} = \frac{O}{H} = \tan{x} \\ \ \\
\therefore \frac{\sin{x}}{\cos{x}} = \tan{x}
$$

- Extending basic trigonometry
  - SOH CAH TOA trigonometric ratios only work for right-angled triangles
  - We need to be able to solve any type of triangle, not just right-angles triangles
  - We need to be able to work with angles >90^o^

- The sine rule
  - Used when you know two sides and an opposite angle

$$
\textrm{For any triangle:} \\ \ \\
\frac{a}{\sin{A}} = \frac{b}{\sin{B}} = \frac{c}{\sin{C}} \\ \ \\
\textrm{and} \\ \ \\
\frac{\sin{A}}{a} = \frac{\sin{B}}{b} = \frac{\sin{C}}{c}
$$

- The cosine rule
  - Used when you know three sides and an angle
  - $\cos(A) = 0$ when A = 90^o^, so Pythagoras' theorem is a special case of the cosine rule for right-angled triangles
  - Note that the cosine must be of the angle opposite the side we are solving for
  - if we are solving for a, we use the term -2bc, if we solve for c, we use the term -2ab etc.

$$
\textrm{For any triangle:} \\ \ \\
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 -2bc \cos{A}
$$

- Area of a triangle
  - If C is 90^o^ ($\sin{90}=1$), this reduces to $\frac{1}{2} \textrm{base} \times \textrm{height}$

$$
\textrm{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}
$$

- Obtuse angles
  - We need to change the definition of sine, cosine, and tangent to work in an obtuse-angled triangle
  - A general angle is a measure of rotation around a point, measured in degrees
  - Positive angles give anticlockwise rotations, negative angles give clockwise rotations

- The ASTC diagram
  - A unit circle centered at (0,0) over x and y axes
  - A line drawn through the origin intersects the circle at point P
  - As point P moves around the circle, the angle ($\theta$) between the x axis and the drawn line changes
  - $y = \sin{\theta}$ (the vertical displacement)
  - $x = \cos{\theta}$ (the horizontal displacement)
  - $\frac{y}{x} = \tan{\theta}$ (y coordinate over the x coordinate)
  - $\sin{\theta}$ has two solutions: $\sin{\theta} = \sin{180 - \theta}$ so it's important to know if the triangle includes an obtuse angle
  - Sine, cosine, and tangent are ALL positive in quadrant 1 (top right) "All"
  - Only sine is positive in quadrant 2 (top left) "Students"
  - Only tangent is positive in quadrant 3 (bottom left) "Take"
  - Only cosine is positive in quadrant 4 (bottom right) "Calculus"

![](@attachment/ATSC 1.png)

- Degrees and radians

$$
1 \textrm{ radian} = \frac{180}{\pi} \textrm{ degrees}
$$

$$
\textrm{\# of radians} = \frac{\textrm{arc length}}{\textrm{radius}}
$$

$$
2\pi \textrm{ radians} = 360^o
$$

- There are infinite solutions to $\sin{0.5}$ (think 1000^o^), but the *principal solution* is the smallest, positive solution
- For equivalent solutions in the range 0-360^o^:
$$
\sin{x} = \sin{(\pi - x)} \\ 
\cos{x} = \cos{(2\pi - x)} \\
\tan{x} = \tan{(\pi - x)}
$$

- For equivalent solutions outside this range:
$$
\sin{x} = \sin{(2\pi n - x)} \\ 
\cos{x} = \cos{(2\pi n - x)} \\
\tan{x} = \tan{(2\pi n - x)}
$$


## Exponentials and logs - 24th September 2021

[Slides](@attachment/RR 2021J session 6 (LS).pdf)

- An exponential equation is one in which a variable is the power, and can be written in the form: $$y = ab^x$$
- If we think of $y$ being a quantity at time $x$, $a$ is the quantity at time 0 and $b$ is the scale factor that controls the rate of change
- If b > 1 we have growth, if 0 < b < 1 we have decay. If b = 1 we have a linear equation.

![](@attachment/Growth and decay.png)
![](@attachment/Growth and decay 2.png)

- IMPORTANT! Although it is possible to find values of e.g. $(-2)^x$ when $x$ is an integer, it is meaningless (in real numbers) to write down something like $y = (-2)^x$ for values of $x$ that are not integers
- Therefore $b$ cannot be negative

- Example of growth:
If rent increases annually by 10% then we can express the rent at year t as:

$$
A = A_0 \times 1.1^t
$$

where $A_0$ is the rent at year 0 and the value of $b$ is 1 + 10% = 1.1

- Example of decay
If the value of a car depreciated by 15% per annum, we can express the value of the car at year t as:

$$
V = V_0 \times 0.85^t
$$

where $A_0$ is the value at year 0 and the value of $b$ is 1 - 15% = 0.85

- *The* exponential function

$$
y = ae^x
$$
  - A function/equation in the form $y = ab^x$ is _an_ exponential function, but the equation above is referred to as _the_ exponential function
  - $e$ is Euler's ("Oiler's") constant and is an irrational number
  - $e$ has the special property that the gradient of the graph of $y = e^x$ has the same value as $y$ for any value of $x$

- Logarithms (logs)
  - The inverse of exponentials
  $$
  \log_2{8} = 3 \\ \ \\
  \textrm{means the same as:} \\ \ \\
  2^3 = 8
  $$

  - The ratio of two logs is the same in any base

  $$
  \frac{\log{23}}{\log{15}} = \frac{\ln{23}}{\ln{15}}
  $$

  - Log rules are similar to those for exponents

  $$
  \log_2{3} + \log_2{5} = \log_2{(3\times5)} = \log_2{15}; \qquad \log{a} + \log{b} = \log{a\times b} \\ \ \\
  \log{20} - \log{5} = \log{\bigg(\frac{20}{5}\bigg)} = \log{4}; \qquad \log{a} - \log{b} = \log{\bigg(\frac{a}{b}\bigg)} \\ \ \\
  \ln{(3^4)} = 4 \ln(3); \qquad \log{(a^b)} = b \log{a}\\ \ \\
  \log{10} = 1; \qquad \log_a{a} = 1 \\ \ \\
  \log{1} = 0
  $$

  - Solving exponential equations with logs, general strategy is to turn an $x$ exponent into a constant
  e.g.

  $$
  2^x = 12 \\
  \ln{(2^x)} = \ln{12} \\
  x \times \ln{2} = \ln{12} \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{\ln{12}}{\ln{2}} = 3.58...
  $$

  If the exponent has multiple terms:

  $$
  5^{x+2} = 0.04  \\
  (x + 2)\ln{5} = \ln{0.04} \\ \ \\
  (x + 2) = \frac{\ln{0.04}}{\ln{5}} \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{\ln{0.04}}{\ln(5)} - 2 = -4
  $$

  If one side has more terms than just $a^x$:

  $$
  2.4 \times 0.85^x = 36 \\ \ \\
  0.85^x = \frac{36}{2.4} \\ \ \\
  x \log{0.85} = \log{15} \\ \ \\
  x = \frac{\log{15}}{\log{0.85}} = -16.66...
  $$
