# Right angled triangles

A triangle in which one of the angles is 90$^{\circ}$ is called a right-angle triangle. The sum of the internal angles in any triangle is 180$^{\circ}$. So if the other two angles are $\alpha$ and $\beta$, then:

$$\alpha + \beta + 90^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} \\ \ \\
\alpha + \beta = 90^{\circ}
$$

Look at the angle $\beta$ in the figure above. The side of the triangle opposite to this is labelled b and is called the **opposite**. The side next to $\beta$ is labelled a and is referred to as the ** adjacent**. The side labelled c is called the **hypotenuse**. The hypotenuse is always the side opposite the right angle.

Pythagoras' theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Looking at the triangle in the figure above, this gives:

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
$$

This formula, together with some knowledge of trigonometry enables us to calculate the angles and sides of the triangle in the figure above (given some other information).
