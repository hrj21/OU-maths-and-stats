# Right-angled triangles - one known side, and two known angles

In the example figure below there are three unknown values: $\alpha$, a, and c, and three known values.

The angle $\beta$ is 30$^{\circ}$ and the side b is 6.0cm. The right angle is 90$^{\circ}$.

The unknown angle $alpha$ can be found using the fact that the sum of the internal angles is 180$^{\circ}$.

$$
\alpha = 180^{\circ} - (90^{\circ} + 30^{\circ}) \\ \ \\
= 180^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} \\ \ \\
= 60^{\circ}
$$

Now calculate a, which is adjacent to the angle $\beta$, which is 30$^{\circ}$. The opposite side is 6.0cm. If we refer back to SOH CAH TOA, we can see that the function relating the adjacent and the opposite is tan.

$$
\textrm{tan } \beta = \frac{\textrm{opposite} (b)}{\textrm{adjacent} (a)} \\ \ \\
a = \frac{b}{\textrm{tan }30^{\circ}} \\ \ \\
a = \frac{6.0\textrm{cm}}{\textrm{tan }30^{\circ}} \\ \ \\
a = \frac{6.0\textrm{cm}}{0.57735} \\ \ \\
a = 10.39\textrm{cm}
$$

The only remaining unknown is c and this can be found using Pythagoras' theorem.

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\ \ \\
c^2 = 10.39^2 + 6.0^2 \\ \ \\
c^2 = 144 \\ \ \\
c = \sqrt{144} = 12\textrm{cm}
$$

## Exercise

> $\alpha = 180^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} - 40^{\circ} = 50^{\circ}$

> $\textrm{Cos }40 = \frac{3}{c}$
> $0.7660444 = \frac{3}{c}$
> $c = \frac{3}{0.7660444}$
> $c = 3.916$

> $\textrm{Sin }40 = \frac{b}{3.916}$
> $0.6427876 = \frac{b}{3.916}$
> $b = 0.6427876 \times 3.916$
> $b = 2.5 \textrm{ (to 2 significant figures)}$
