# Right-angled triangles - two unknown values, and one unknown value

In the right-angled triangle below, the length of two sides are known, and just one angle - the right angle.

The aim is to calculate the values of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and b.

This time the length of two sides are known. IN relation to the angle $\beta$, they are the adjacent and the hypotenuse. The trig function that relates these two sides is cosine.

$$
\textrm{Cos }\beta = \frac{\textrm{adjacent}}{\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3.0}{5.0} = 0.6\textrm{cm}
$$

This means that $\beta$ is the angle for which cos is 0.6; this can be written as

$$
\beta = \textrm{cos}^{-1}(0.6)
$$

$\textrm{Cos}^{-1}$ is the opposite or inverse, of taking the cosine of an angle and will give the angle (between 0$^{\circ}$ and 180$^{\circ}$) with the cosine value of 0.6. Fortunately, your calculator also does this for you.

Look at your calculator again. You should see a key that has the word shift or the letters *inv* above it. This key enables you tu use the inverse functions on a calculator. Look at your sin, cos, and tan keys again. Above each you should see what are known as the inverse functions, sin$^{-1}$, cos$^{-1}$, and tan$^{-1}$.

Depending on the calculator, you will either need to key in the function first or the number. Either way

$$\textrm{cos}^{-1}(0.6) = 53.130$$

so the angle $\beta$ with a cosine of 0.6 is 53$^{\circ}$ (to two significant figures).

Let's look at that right angle triangle again.

$\alpha$ can now be found as before:

$$
\alpha + \beta = 90^{\circ} \\ \ \\
\alpha = 90^{\circ} - \beta \\ \ \\
\alpha = 90^{\circ} - 53.130 = 36Â° \textrm{ (2 s.f.)}
$$

The opposite side b can be found using Pyhtagoras' theorem.

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\ \ \\
5^2 = 3^2 + b^2 \\ \ \\
25 - 9 = b^2 \\ \ \\
b = \sqrt{16} = 4.0\textrm{cm}
$$

## Exercise 1
Find the angles $\beta$ and $\alpha$ and the length of side a.

> $\textrm{sin }\beta = \frac{5}{8} = 0.625$
> $\textrm{sin}^{-1}(0.625) = 38.6821^{\circ}$
> $\beta = 39^{\circ} \textrm{ (2 s.f.)}$

> $\alpha = 180^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} - 38.6821^{\circ} = 51.3178^{\circ}$
> $\alpha = 51^{\circ} \textrm{ (2 s.f.)}$

> $8^2 = a^2 + 5^2$
> $64 = a^2 + 25$
> $a = \sqrt{39} = 6.2 \textrm{cm (2 s.f.)}$

## Exercise 2
Find the sides a and b and the angle $\alpha$.

> $\textrm{cos} 45 = 0.7071 = \frac{a}{6}$
> $a = 0.7071 \times 6.0 = 4.2426$
> $a = 4.2 \textrm{cm (2 s.f.)}$

> $36 = 18 + b^2$
> $18 = b^2$
> $b = \sqrt{18} = 4.2 \textrm{cm (2 s.f.)}$

> $\alpha = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45^{\circ}$
