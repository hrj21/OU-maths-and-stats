# Significant figures
When quoting the result of a measurement, you should never quote more digits than you can justify in terms of the uncertainty in the measurment. The number of **significant figures** in the value of a measured quantity is defined as the number of digits known with certainty plus one uncertain digit. Leading zeroes in decimal numbers do not count as significant figures.

For example, the measurements 13mm, 1.3cm, and 0.013m all have 2 significant figures.

In any calculation, you should make sure that your answer is no more precise than the least precide data that you started with. If you calculated the area of a rectangle with sides measuring 2.34m and 4.2m, the ares should only be shown to 2 significant figures, since there are only  significant figures in the least-precisely known value, the 4.2m.

With large numbers that have trailing zeroes, it can be ambiguous as to whether they are integers or are rounded to a number of significant figures. This can be cleared up by using scientific notation. For example, 800cm can be shown as $8 \times 10^2$cm, making it clear the quantity is known only to 1 significant figure.
