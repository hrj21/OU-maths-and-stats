# Simplifying algebraic expressions

Whenever you wish to solve an expression, you should first rearrange it to make it as simple as possible, then manipulate it. If you try to manipulate expressions in a complex form, you increase the probability of making mistakes or becoming confused. Once the expression has been simplified, you can either solve it or state it in its most simplified form.

## Sequence of arithmetical calculations

You may be familiar with the acronym BIDMAS (or BODMAS or BEDMAS). This is a reminder that in any sum there is a standard order in which to carry out the calculations. That is:

**B**rackets (or parentheses for Americans)
**I**ndices (or orders)
**D**ivision
**M**ultiplication
**A**ddition
**S**ubtraction

> Note that division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction, are performed in their left to right order, once the preceding steps have been done.

Let's look at the example

$$4 + 2 \times 7$$

Carrying this out from left to right, without considering BIDMAS gives

$$4 + 2 \times 7 = 6 \times 7 = 42$$

And now using BIDMAS:

$$4 + 2 \times 7 = 4 + 14 = 18$$

Two very different answers, showing why the accepted order of BIDMAS is so vital. 

To clarify the order, or to change the order that operations are carried out in, you can use brackets:

$$4 + (2 \times 7)$$

So now the intended order of operation is clear. If the brackets had been included to show $(4 + 2) \times 7$, this would change the order of operation.

Just as with arithmetic, algebra has rules and conventions in the way that is operates. In other words, there are things that you have to do (rules) and things that mean that mathematics is presented consistently (conventions). Conventionally, when there are no brackets, multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction; most calculators do this automatically. Other useful conventions are:

- writing $4n$ instead of $4 \times n$; $4mn$ is $4 \times m \times n$
- writing $4n$ rather than $n4$
- writing the product of $x$ by itself as $x^2$ instead of $xx$
- writing $x$ rather than $1x$

## Worked example
Simplify

$$12t + 13t^2 -4 -6t + 3t^2 \\ \ \\= 16t^2 + 6t - 4 \\ \ \\ = 8t^2 + 3t -2$$

Useful rules:
- when adding like terms, add the coefficients (e.g. $2x + 5x = 7x$)
- don’t mix powers of the same variable - you can’t add $x + 2x^2$ to give a single term, as they represent different numbers; for example, when $x = 2$, $x^2 = 4$.

By convention, the terms with the highest power go at the start of the expression.

## Exercises
Simplify the following:

1) $2t^2 + 4t^2$
> $6t^2$

2) $6y - 8y^2 + 4y^2 - 2y$
> $-4y^2 + 4y$

3) $4c^3 + 2c^2d - 4 - c^2d$
> $4c^3 + c^2d - 4$

4) $12 + 2r^2 - 4rs - 3r^2 + 5rs$
> $-r^2 + rs + 12$

5) $\frac{a^2}{2} + 3a^2 + a - a^2 + \frac{a}{4}$
> $\frac{5a^2}{2} + \frac{5a}{4}$
