# Simultaneous equations

Simultaneous equations are pairs of equations that are both true. They are both expressed as equations with two unknowns. By making one of these unknowns the subject of both equations, you can then substitute the subject in one equation and then solve for the other unknown. Then you can substitute back into the equation for the first unknown.

Here is a pair of simultaeous equations to solve for $x$ and $y$:

$$
2y = x + 7 \\ \ \\
y = x + 2
$$

First, you need to rearrange these equations to make either $x$ or $y$ the subject. The order doesn't matter, as the answers that you will get must be the same. So, starting by making $x$ the subject:

$$
x = 2y - 7 \\ \ \\
x = y - 2
$$

Now there are two expressions for $x$, so the right-hand sides must be equal, and you can equate them:

$$
2y - 7 = y - 2 \\ \ \\
y = 5
$$

You can then substitute this back into either of the original equations to find $x$.

$$
2y = x + 7\\ \ \\
2\times 5 = x + 7 \\ \ \\
10 - 7 = x \\ \ \\
x = 3
$$

As a last check, make sure this is true of the other equation.

$$
y = x + 2 \\ \ \\
5 = x + 2 \\ \ \\
x = 3
$$

## Exercises
Solve the following simultaneous equations.

1) $y = x + 10$        $3y = 2x + 5$
> $x + 10 = \frac{(2x + 5)}{3}$
> $3x + 30 = 2x + 5$
> $x = -25$
> 
> $y = -25 + 10$
> $y = -15$
>
> $3 \times -15 = 2 \times -25 + 5$
> $-45 = -45$

2) $y = 4x$            $y = 3x + 5$
>

3) $y = 7x + 4$        $3y = x + 7$
>

4) $y = 2x + 4$        $3y = x + 7$
