# Sine, cosine, and tangent

Sin, cos, and tan are the commonly used abbreviations for each function, so that:

**Sin = sine**
**Cos = cosine**
**Tan = tangent**

Sine is pronounced "sign" and cosine as "co-sign". Based on the triangle in the figure below these functions are defined as follows:

$$
\textrm{sin } \beta = \frac{\textrm{opposite} (b)}{\textrm{hypotenuse} (c)} \\ \ \\
\textrm{cos } \beta = \frac{\textrm{adjacent} (a)}{\textrm{hypotenuse} (c)} \\ \ \\
\textrm{tan} \beta = \frac{\textrm{opposite} (b)}{\textrm{adjacent} (a)}
$$

An easy way to remember this is SOH CAH TOA ("sock-ah-toa"):

$$
\textrm{Sin} = \frac{O}{H} \\ \ \\
\textrm{Cos} = \frac{A}{H} \\ \ \\
\textrm{Tan} = \frac{O}{H}
$$

Using these functions and Pythagoras' theorem, if you know two sides or a side and an angle for a right-angled triangle, then you can find the other side, sides, or angle as required.

## Exercises
Ensuring your calculator is set to degrees, work out these values for sine and cosine.

1) Sin 0$^{\circ}$
> 0

2) Cos 0$^{\circ}$
> 1

3) Sin 10$^{\circ}$
> 0.1736

4) Cos 10$^{\circ}$
> 0.9848

5) Sin 25$^{\circ}$
> 0.42262

6) Cos 25$^{\circ}$
> 0.9063

7) Sin 45$^{\circ}$
> 0.7071

8) Cos 45$^{\circ}$
> 0.7071

9) Sin 70$^{\circ}$
> 0.9397

10) Cos 70$^{\circ}$
> 0.3420

11) Sin 90$^{\circ}$
> 1

12) Cos 90$^{\circ}$
> 0

## The range of sine and cosine

Notice that all the values for the sine and cosine functions lie between 0 and 1 for angles between 0$^{\circ}$ and 90$^{\circ}$. Also as the values for sine increase, the values for cosine decrease.

The two graphs below show the shape of the sine and cosine functions between 0$^{\circ}$ and 30$^{\circ}$. From this you can see both functions stay within -1 and +1.

As shown in the figure below the tangent function is not similar in the way that cosine and sine are but forms its own repeating pattern

**Tangent**

In the next section we'll look at how you can use these functions with right-angled triangles.
