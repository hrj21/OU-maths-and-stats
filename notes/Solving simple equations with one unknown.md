# Solving simple equations with one unknown

Consider the equation $4x = 24$. As it is written $x$ is the unknown and to solve this equation you need to find the value of x, which makes the statement $4x = 24$ true.

You may be able to see this straight away, but if not, divide both sides of the equation by 4, to get an answer for $x$.

$$
4x = 24 \\ \ \\
\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{24}{4} \\ \ \\
x = 6
$$

You can check the accuracy of your answer by substituting the value of $x$ back into the original equation: $4 \times 6 = 24$.

## Exercises 1
Solve the following equations for $x$:

1) $3x = 6$
> $x = 2$

2) $7x = 21$
> $x = 3$

3) $8x = 32$
> $x = 4$

4) $x + 3 = 9$
> $x = 6$

5) $x + 6 = 7$
> $x = 1$

6) $x + 7 = 11$
> $x = 4$

## Exercises 2
Solve the following equations for $x$:

1) $2x – 1 = 7$
> $x = 4$

2) $5x – 8 = 2$
> $x = 2$

3) $3x + 8 = 5$
> $x = -1$

4) $3x – 8 = 5x – 20$
> $x = 6$

5) $3(x + 1) = 9$
> $x = 2$

6) $23 – x = x + 11$
> $x = 6$

7) $2(x – 3) – (x – 2) = 5$
> $x = 9$

8) $\frac{4x}{5} = 12$
> $x = 15$

9) $\frac{x}{3} = \frac{2}{5}$
> $x = \frac{6}{5}$

10) $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{5} = 2$
> $m = \frac{15}{4}$

11) $\frac{x}{4} - \frac{x}{7} = 2$
> $x = 56/3$
