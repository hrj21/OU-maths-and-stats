# The logarithmic scale

On a *linear* scale, each step from one division of the scale to the next represents an addition or subtraction. On a *logarithmic* scale, each step represents a multiplication or division by a fixed power of 10. As a result, the intervals between divisions are different.

## Loudness
The decibel (dB) is the unit used to measure relative loudness of sounds. The "intensity" of the sound is related to the square of the variation in pressure as the sound passes through the air, and the range of intensities that people can detect is enormous. The sound that just causes pain is $10^{12}$ times more intense than the sound that is just audible. To deal with this, a logarithmic scale for loudness was devised, according to which every 10 dB (or "bel") increase in sound level is equivalent to a 10-fold increase in intensity. 1 dB is just within the limit of human hearing, and a change of 1dB is about the smallest different in sound the ear can detect.

## Earthquakes
The *Richter scale* describes the magnitude of earthquakes and is a measure of the maximum ground movement caused by an earthquake. Some earthquakes can produce ground movements millions of times greater than the minimum detectable limit. To cope with this huge variation, the Richter scale is logarithmic: an increase of one unit on the scale implies a ten-fold increase in the maximum ground movement. A magnitude 3 earthquake produces 10 times more ground motion than a magnitude 2 earthquake.
