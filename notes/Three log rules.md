# Three log rules
The three log rules can be deduced from the rules of indicies you learned in Week 1.

## Rule r

$$\textrm{log}_a xy = \textrm{log}_a x + \textrm{log}_a y$$

So the log of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithms of each term in the product.

If $\textrm{log}_a x = m$ and $\textrm{log}_a y = n$, this means that $x = a^m$ and $y = a^n$. Therefore:

$$
xy = a^m
$$
