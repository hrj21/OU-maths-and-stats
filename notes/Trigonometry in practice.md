# Trigonometry in practice

One application of trigonometry in physics concerns the resolution of forces. This enables a force acting in a certain direction to be shown as two component forces, at right angles to each other.

Consider the case of a father pulling his two children along on a sledge. He has a rope attached to the sledge that makes an angle $\alpha$ with the ground. Knowing that the force F on the rope is 50N and $\alpha$ is 25$^{\circ}$, you can find the horizontal and vertical components of the force.

The force F acting in the rope may be considered as two component forces. The horizontal component can be called F~h~ and the vertical component F~v~, as shown below.

Looking at the figure and applying the trigonometry from earlier in this section, the following can be stated:

F~h~ is the adjacent, F~v~ is the opposite and 50N is the hypotenuse.

$$
\textrm{cos }\alpha = \frac{F_h}{50\textrm{N}}
$$

and

$$
\textrm{sin }\alpha = \frac{F_v}{50\textrm{N}}
$$

Rearranging these equations gives

$$
F_h = 50\textrm{N} \textrm{ cos }25^{\circ} \\ \ \\
= 50\textrm{N} \times 0.9063 \\ \ \\
= 45.32\textrm{N} = 45 \textrm{N (2 s.f.)}
$$

The horizontal component of the force is 45.32N.

$$
F_v = 50\textrm{N} \textrm{ sin }25^{\circ} \\ \ \\
= 50\textrm{N} \times 0.9063 \\ \ \\
= 21.13\textrm{N} = 21\textrm{N (2 s.f.)}
$$

The vertical component of the force is 21.13N. Checking these answers with Pythagoras' theorem should show that $F_h^2 + F_v^2 = F^2$.

$$
45.32^2 + 21.13^2 = 2053.484 + 446.515 \\ \ \\
= 2500 = 50^2
$$

This check gives us extra confidence the answer is correct.

## Exercise
Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of the force F in the worked example above if:

1) the angle $\alpha$ is reduced to 15$^{\circ}$
> $F_v = \textrm{sin }15 \times 50$
> $F_v = 13N$

> $F_h = \textrm{cos }15 \times 50$
> $F_v = 48N$

2) the angle $\alpha$ is increased to 45$^{\circ}$
> $F_v = \textrm{sin }45 \times 50$
> $F_v = 35N$

> $F_h = \textrm{cos }45 \times 50$
> $F_v = 35N$

> When the angle is 45$^{\circ}$, the horizontal forces are equal. When the angle is smaller, the horizontal force dominates.
