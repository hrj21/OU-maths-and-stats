# Why use algebra?

You may have used formulas before such as

$$speed = \frac{distance}{time}$$

This example allows you to calculate the speed of an object taking a known length of time to travel a known distance. Similarly, if you knew the speed and distance travelled, rearranging the equation would allow you to calculate the time taken. 

Algebra is a powerful mathematical tool that enables generalisation - something may seem to be true for many sets of specific data values, but is it true for all such sets?

## Generalising algebra

Find the sum of three consecutive numbers or integers. Divide your answer by 3. What do you notice? The result appears to be divisible exactly by 3, and is the middle of the three numbers.

The pattern can be explained by working out a formula for this calculation. Suppose you call the first number $n$, that means that as the three numbers are consecutive, the second number can be writtern as $n + 1$, and the third as $n + 2$. So the sum of any three consecutive numbers is

$$n + (n + 1) + (n + 2)$$

This can be simplified by carrying out the sum:

$$n + n + n + 3$$

Since there are 3 lots of n, this can be shown as $3n$. Thus, 

$$n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3$$

The next instruction is to divide the sum by 3 whic gives

$$\frac{3n + 3}{3} = n + 1$$

Therefore, the product of three consecutive numbers is always divisible by exactly 3 and is the middle of the three numbers.
